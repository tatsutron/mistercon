# mistercon

mistercon is an Android app for use with [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki). It is designed to remotely control your MiSTer and to supplement its built-in user interface.

* Search for games by name and launch them from your phone
* Mark the best games to create a list of your favorites
* Import metadata for your games, including front and back cover images, from [OpenVGDB](https://github.com/OpenVGDB)
* ([Patron](https://patreon.com/tatsutron) only) Launch games by scanning QR codes with your phone's camera

More features are always in development. Follow our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tatsutron) for behind-the-scenes updates.

# Will there be an iOS version?

We get asked about a possible iOS app more than anything else, and we would love to develop one! Maintaining a whole second native app would be quite an undertaking for our little two-woman operation. Now that Casey left her full-time job, we'd have enough time if she didn't have to work on other stuff to cover our bills. If we can find enough [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tatsutron) support out there to replace that income, she'd be thrilled to just work on mistercon all day! 🙂
