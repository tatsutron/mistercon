# mistercon

mistercon is an Android app for use with [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki). It is designed to support features which MiSTer eschews e.g. displaying metadata and artwork. Hat tip to [mrsonicblue](https://github.com/mrsonicblue) and [pocamane](https://github.com/pocomane) for doing the work that this project is built upon.

# Features

* Import data and artwork for Gameboy, GBA, Genesis, SNES, and TGFX16 games
* Launch games, access the menu, run scripts, and reboot the MiSTer from your Android device

# Credits

This project is made possible by DoOoM, KremlingKuthroat19, Luke Earnshaw, and Mist Sonata.
