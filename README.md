# MiSTer Controller

mistercon is an Android app for use with [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki). It is designed to support features which MiSTer eschews e.g. displaying metadata and artwork.

# Prerequisites

mistercon requires [MiSTer Batch Control](https://github.com/pocomane/MiSTer_Batch_Control) to be installed at  `/media/fat/misc/MiSTer_Batch_Control/mbc`. Also, console cores must be located at `/media/fat/_Console` and games at `/media/fat/games`. Note also that you'll need the IP address of your MiSTer to connect it with the app.

# Installation

Grab the latest APK from the [releases](https://github.com/tatsutron/remote/tree/main/releases) folder and install it on your favorite Android device.
